    "# Spark \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is a big-data processing framework that I describe as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have a lot of data.\n",
    "2. We will split our data into chunks, called \"partitions\".\n",
    "3. We read data in partitions, we write data in partitions, and all the processing in between, happens in partitions. \n",
    "4. Given that data is in partitions, each partition can be worked on in parallel, in serial, or a combination of both. \n",
    "5. Much of the \"behind-the-scenes\" magic of Spark consists of scheduling the work of processing each partition to a different \"worker\", where workers are potentially spread across machines.\n",
    "6. Much of the day-to-day work of a Spark programmer consists of trying to compute what you want to compute, given the constraint that your data is all split up into a bunch of f(*&#@ing partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is succesful because this framework of splitting data up into partitions is a very useful abstraction that's extremely _flexible_. You can work with very very large data, do basically anything you want with the data, and do so across any number of machines. That's very powerful! \n",
    "\n",
    "But computing with big data efficiently requires the programmer to consider the underlying data model of partitions. Sometimes we need data to be partitioned in a different way then it comes. Spark can shuffle data between partitions in this instance, but \"shuffling\" is an expensive operation. The goal is always to do everything you want while avoiding the need to shuffle data between partitions as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "We already know one basic pattern that is super efficient in this framework: Map + Reduce! \n",
    "\n",
    "By it's very definition, map works on each partition (indeed, one each \"row\" or element individually). Reduce is an operation that \"folds\" each element of the data into an \"accumulator\" via a given operation. If the reduce operation is commutative and associative (like `sum`), it can be done first within a partition and then the results from each partition combined via the same function across partitions. This is the simplest way to \"aggregate\" our data into a result."

    "\n",
    "The RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is the fundamental data structure of Spark. You can think of it as a partitioned list!\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame's are a higher-level construct built on top of RDDs. They have \"schemas\" which means that each column has a \"type\" (ie string, int, etc.). Unlike our basic, old-school SQL database, columns can be nested! Because the columns have types, Spark can optimize operations in a Dataframe. In general, they allow us to easily write SQL-style operations on our data with super-optimized execution under-the-hood. This is great for a large set of analytics use-cases!\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule of thumb is: use DataFrames if you can fit what you're trying to do within their API, because it will usually be faster, otherwise use the RDDs directly if you need the flexibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will be focusing on RDDs, because it's educational and simple to get started with.\n"
